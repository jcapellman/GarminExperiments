# jcGAI
Repository for a SaaS Insights Platform on your Garmin data (specifically Cycling).  While the Garmin Connect app provides some level of trends, I found it to be lacking in real detail. After purchasing a Strava subscription, I was somewhat disappointed in that effort as well.  Answering simple questions of trends in my riding over time, factoring in my sleep, other stresses etc. should be factored.  This REST service attempts to answer those questions.
